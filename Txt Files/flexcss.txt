Flex
========
1.display:flex
2.flex-direction:row/column
3.justify-content:flex-start/flex-end/space-around/space-evenly/center
4.margin-auto:left/right(to align the flex boxes left or right)
5.flex:1 1 0(for responsive)[[[[[Flex is the shorthand property for flex:
    flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis]]]]]
6.height:100%(for vertical responsive)
7.align-items:center
8.align-self:flex-start/flex-end(For single box alignment)
9.For exact center(both vertical and horizontal center)-->
    justify-content:center   align-items:center
10.If you give width for the boxes,flex-wrap:wrap/no-wrap comes into picture.If you give wrap then it will occupy only for the width you are given.So give flex-wrap according to your specification.


MARGINS
--------
HORIZONTAL CENTERING CAN BE DONE BY USING MARGINS
1.GIVE SOME SPECIFIC WIDTHS
2.margin:0 auto(SHOULD MAKE MARGIN-LEFT AND MARGIN-RIGHT TO AUTO)

IF NOT GIVING WIDTHS: MARGINS AUTO WON'T WORK
MARGINS-TOP AND BOTTOM WON'T AFFECT FOR VERTICALLY CENTERING

TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY(makes the element to stretchable(like in newspapers))
DRY
-----
ALWAYS USE CSS BY DRY PRINCIPLE(MAKE SOME COMMON TAGS AND USE THAT TAGS 
FOR REPETITION) 
ALWAYS
